# Natural_Gas_Forecasting_For_Hedging

This thesis develops an integrated framework combining natural gas price forecasting with dynamic hedging strategies, addressing the central research question: "Can price and market regime predictions improve hedging strategies' performance?"
The project employs a structured three-phase methodology applied to the European natural gas market (TTF - Title Transfer Facility) over the period 2015-2024. The first phase implements deep learning models (LSTM and CNN-LSTM) for price forecasting, utilizing both univariate and multivariate approaches with exogenous variables including other energy commodity prices and geopolitical risk indicators. The second phase classifies market regimes in terms of volatility (Low, Medium, High) and direction (Bear, Neutral, Bull). Finally, the third phase integrates these predictions into a option-based hedging simulation, comparing forecast-based approaches against classical strategies. 
Empirical results demonstrate that while the CNN-LSTM model does not consistently outperform the LSTM in all settings, the performance across both forecasting and classification tasks suggest that CNN-based architectures offer better generalization and flexibility when additional features are introduced. This aligns with recent findings in the literature (Livieris et al., 2020) where similar architectures were tested in energy market scenarios and supports the frameworkâ€™s methodological focus on replicability and adaptability across different predictive objectives. Lastly, the simulation results provide encouraging support for the practical relevance of the framework. Forecast-based strategies generally perform better than classical approaches, delivering improved cumulative returns and better downside control under the tested conditions. While the simulation is based on a simplified environment, the outcomes suggest that incorporating predictive signals into hedging decisions can offer tangible benefits and represents a promising direction for further research and practical exploration.
